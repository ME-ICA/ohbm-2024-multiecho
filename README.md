# Multi-echo fMRI: OHBM 2024

This contains materials related to tedana and multi-echo fMRI presented at the Organization for Human Brain Mapping 2024 Annual Meeting

This is a place to centralize multi-echo related content at OHBM 2024. If you see or have a poster or presentation using multi-echo fMRI, submit a pull request or [comment on issue #1](https://github.com/ME-ICA/ohbm-2024-multiecho/issues/1) to have it added.

## Multi-echo fMRI users' gathering

At OHBM 2023, a group of multi-echo fMRI users had an informal gathering at a bar. We will attempt to do this again, but have not yet picked a time or location. If you want to join us, please reach out to [@handwerkerd](https://github.com/handwerkerd) or other [tedana contributors](https://github.com/ME-ICA/tedana/?tab=readme-ov-file#contributors) at OHBM.

## Multi-echo presentations
- Longitudinal iron in caudate related to control network connectivity and planning in older adults
- Multimodal precision neuroimaging of the individual human brain at ultra-high field

Both in Neuroscience Frontiers: Exploring Cognitive Dynamics and Brain Connectivity
Monday, June 24, 2024: 5:45 PM - 7:00 PM
